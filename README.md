## **Overview**
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify which existing customers are most likely to accept a limited-time VIP membership offer from a retail chain. The goal is to support a more targeted and efficient phone call marketing campaign.

The methodology involved investigating various data preprocessing strategies—including outlier removal and testing different sequences of scaling, balancing, and train-test splitting—to optimize data quality. Multiple classification models were compared to predict customer acceptance, and feature selection and SHAP analysis were applied to identify key factors influencing customer acceptance.
